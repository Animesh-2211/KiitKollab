The dynamically built multi-shot prompt improves the FM's proficiency in advanced math computation, time series data processing, and data acronym interpretation while also giving the FM the most pertinent context. This enhanced response makes it easier for operational teams and enterprise employees to interact with data and derive insights without requiring a high level of data science expertise."
